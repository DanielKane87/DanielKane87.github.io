		<h1>MY EXPERIENCE WITH AUTISM</h1>
	</div>
	<p>Most people wouldn't be able to tell that I'm autistic unless I outright told them.<br>
	While I do still exhibit some autistic behaviors, such as social difficulty and comfort in isolation,<br>
	my symptoms are so negligible that I can go through life without much difficulty.
	</p>
	<p>When I was little, though, I wasn't able to speak at the age that most kids should be speaking.<br>
	Thankfully, I was able to attend a special school and learned how to speak,<br>
	so now I can speak just as eloquently as anyone else.
	</p>
	<p>Attached below is the outline of a speech on autism I gave in my Oral Communciation class in the style of a TedEx talk.<br>
	I had to memorize all of the information I could and was allowed to use some slides as guidelines.<br>
