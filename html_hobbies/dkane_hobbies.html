			<h1>PLAYING VIDEO GAMES</h1>
			<img loading="lazy" src="hobby1_image.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;"> 
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>Playing video games is my favorite pastime. My first console was the WiiU, on which I played
		some of my favorite games of all time, including:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_8">Mario Kart 8</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Land">Nintendo Land</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Sports_Resort">Wii Sports Resort</a></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>While I still do use the WiiU, I'm primarily a PC gamer nowadays, playing games like Portal,
		Portal 2, Garry's Mod, Minecraft, and Geometry Dash.
		</p>
		<p>I love video games so much that I plan to have a career in video game design! To learn more
		about the topic of my video game inspirations and future plans, check out "Video Games" using
		the Site Navigation bar at the bottom of the page.

			<h1>DRAWING</h1>
			<img loading="lazy" src="hobby2_image.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;"> 
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>I like to draw every so often. While I sometimes dabble in pencil/pen drawing, I'm primarily
		a digital artist. I'm not particularly good at backgrounds (yet), so I usually just end up
		drawing people. I would say that at my current level, I'm pretty ok when it comes to art. 
		</p>
		<p> I have always been inspired by the detailed artwork of Japanese manga. If I weren't going 
		into video game design, I would probably try my hand at being a comics artist. 
		</p>
		<p>Some of my favorite manga based on their art are:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blame!">"Blame!"</a> by Tsutomu Nihei</li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure">The "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure" series</a> by Hirohiko Araki, especially Part 7: "Steel Ball Run"</li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainsaw_Man">"Chainsaw Man"</a> by Tatsuki Fujimoto</li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_the_Lustrous">"Land of the Lustrous"</a> by Haruko Ichikawa</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>I am also inspired by the art of the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion and the films
		of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.

			<h1>WRITING</h1>
			<img loading="lazy" src="hobby3_image.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;"> 
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>This is the hobby I engage in the least. Whenever it comes to sitting down and writing
		some kind of story, I find myself easily deterred by roadblocks and lacking motivation.
		While I often spend a lot of time outlining the information that will go into a story, the
		process by which the story unfolds that information in a natural way seems to be where I struggle.
		</p>
		<p>All I can really show for this particular aspect of my life so far are three wiki pages
		I have made to hold the information of three story ideas based on the "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"
		series by Hirohiko Araki:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://jojofanon.fandom.com/wiki/JoJo_4_%2B_8:_Double_Helix">JoJo 4 + 8: Double Helix<a/></li>
				<li><a href="https://jojofanon.fandom.com/wiki/JoJo_5_%2B_7:_Golden_Wind,_Steel_Ball">JoJo 5 + 7: Golden Wind, Steel Ball<a/></li>
				<li><a href="https://jojofanon.fandom.com/wiki/JoJo_6_%2B_9:_Americana_Breakdown">JoJo 6 + 9: Americana Breakdown<a/></li>
			</ul>

			<h1>READING</h1>
			<img loading="lazy" src="hobby4_image.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;"> 
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>Reading is another hobby that I engage in irregularly. In pursuit of expanding my literary
		tastes, I have try to compile a "library" using book suggestions from one of my high school
		teacher.
		</p>
		<p>The majority of my favorite books are ones I had to read in high school and then re-read
		later so I could appreciate them outside of an academic, assignment-based environment.
		</p>
		<p>
		Some of my favorite books are "The Martian Chronicles" by Ray Bradbury, <br> "Crime and Punishment" by
		Fyodor Dostoevsky, "1984" by George Orwell, <br> "That Hideous Strength" by C. S. Lewis,
		the Old English poem "Beowulf", and "Dune" by Frank Herbert.

			<h1>MAKING MUSIC</h1>
			<img loading="lazy" src="hobby5_image.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;"> 
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>Occasionally, I like to play around with making music! I primarily use FL Studio,
		a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). Recently, I have been getting into using
		MuseScore in order to make professional-looking sheet music.
		</p>
		<p>To hear and see examples of songs I've worked on, check out "Musical Interests" using the
		Site Navigation bar at the bottom of the page.
