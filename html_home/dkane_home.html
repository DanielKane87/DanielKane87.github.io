		<h1>MY HOMETOWN</h1>
	</div>
	
	<p>Las Vegas is the place I call home sweet home (when I'm not at university).<br>
	That's right. I'm from Sin City, the land of casinos and partying.<br> However,
	unlike what popular opinion seems to hold, I don't spend every weekend at
	The Strip or anything of the like. <br> In fact, I've probably been to The Strip
	once in my entire life.
	</p>
	<p>Below are images featuring the most important locations in my lifetime
	at Las Vegas (excluding my household for obvious security reasons).

		<p>Jacobson Elementary School. I attended school here from kindergarten 
		to 3rd grade.<br> After 3rd grade I was pulled out of the public school system
		and homeschooled until my sophomore year of high school.
		</p>
		<img loading="lazy" src="high_school.jpg" style="width:700px;">
		<p>Founders Classical Academy. I attended school here from sophomore year to senior year of high school.</p>
		<img loading="lazy" src="st_bridgets.jpg" style="width:700px;">
		<p>St. Bridget's Catholic Church. I attended mass here for 19 years before the Latin Mass was switched
		over to the Shrine of the Holy Redeemer, featured next.</p>
		<img loading="lazy" src="shrine.jpg" style="width:700px;">
		<p>The Shrine of the Holy Redeemer. This is where my family and I currently attend Mass, and where I also
		sing as part of the church choir.
