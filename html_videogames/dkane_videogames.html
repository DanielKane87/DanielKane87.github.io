				<p>Games with low-poly graphics like <em><span style="font-size:1.4em;color:red">Signalis</span></em> 
				are very eye-catching to me,<br> and I desire to incorporate those kinds of graphics into
				several of my video game creations if possible.<br>Something about them just brings
				nostalgia to my mind!<br>(Probably due to the fact that low-poly graphics
				inspire thoughts of the dawn of video games.)
				<br><br>I also find the relationships between man, machine, and artificial intelligence to be
				quite fascinating.<br> I will certainly try to explore these relationships and themes
				in my own way through my games.
				</p>

			<div class="h-container">
				<p>RPGs like <em><span style="font-size:1.4em;color:red">Undertale</span></em>,
				<em><span style="font-size:1.4em;color:red">Yume Nikki</span></em>,
				<em><span style="font-size:1.4em;color:red">Omori</span></em>, and
				<em><span style="font-size:1.4em;color:red">Earthbound</span></em>
				<br>
				are interesting to me because while they may have simplistic graphics,<br>
				they are able to explore heavy themes<br>- such as depression and the consequences of choice -<br>
				and they often acquire large, devoted fanbases.
				<br><br>I am interested in using this genre to explore some other kinds of themes,<br>
				such as identity, loneliness and intimacy, and the nature of good and evil.

				<img loading="lazy" src="polybius_cover.jpeg" style="width:400px;height:400px;">
				<p>While it is merely a hoax, the urban legend of <em><span style="font-size:1.4em;color:red">Polybius</span></em>
				has intrigued me ever since I learned about it.<br>One of the games in my catalog of ideas is
				based on the legend of Polybius,<br> presenting itself as surrealist and jarring to reflect the
				ambiguity of what exactly<br>Polybius could have been like.

				<p>The films of <em><span style="font-size:1.4em;color:red">Studio Ghibli</span></em>, directed by Hayao Miyazaki,<br>
				feature some of the most beautiful art I have ever seen,<br>
				from the majesty of the giant airships to the softness of<br>
				the character interactions and landscapes.
				<br><br>While I do want to explore dark, heavy themes in my games,<br>
				I think it will be good to contrast those games with ones<br> that explore themes like Ghibli's films,<br>
				such as the relationship between man and nature, progress vs. tradition, and youth.

				<img loading="lazy" src="nge_cover.jpg" style="width:400px;height:400px;">
				<p><em><span style="font-size:1.4em;color:red">Neon Genesis Evangelion</span></em> is not only one of
				my favorite science fiction anime of all time,<br> but is quite possibly my favorite anime of all time, period.<br>
				The show has masterful execution of its art and the psychoanalysis of its characters,<br> both by themselves and with others.<br> 
				After watching it, I have become very mindful of themes like escapism and intimacy.<br>
				I aspire to analyze and deconstruct the ideals of my characters and explore these themes<br> and more with them in my games.

		<h1>Video Games as a Career</h1>
		<div class="h-container">
			<p>With all of this having been said, it should be obvious that I desire a variety with my catalog of games;<br>
			variety in art style, variety in tone, variety in genre, etc.
			<br><br>
			My design philosophy will be:<br>
			"Better to take a long time to make something excellent, then to be quick and settle for mediocrity."
			<br><br>
			I do not wish to fall into the trap that many modern video game companies encounter - pushing out buggy games for quick money.<br> 
			I think video games deserve to be respected as the artform they are,<br>
			and I will take the time necessary to make my games memorable and pleasing.
